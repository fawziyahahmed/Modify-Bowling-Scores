# Modify Bowling Scores Using Structure
## Descriptions:
### This program will calculate a bowling league's average bowling scores from the "BowlingScores.txt" file. It calculates the average of 5 bowling scores. This program uses a structure that contains a string data type that will hold the name of the bowler, a one-dimensional array of integers to store the bowler's 4 scores, and an integer to hold the average bowling score. Moreover, it contains 3 functions called GetBowlingData(), GetAverageScore(), and PrettyPrintResults() along with a main() to read and store data, calculate the average bowling score, and output the results. 
## How is it useful?
### From this program you will learn how to use structure, stored data from a text file and calculate the average, and how to store data into arrays using loops!
